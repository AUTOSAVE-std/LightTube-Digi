LightTube-Digi is a software specifically made for **SEENSPACE Huahin**, Thailand in 2016 Newyear Party, made by **AUTOSAVE studio** 


### Tell me what this does!
Basically, this software show 5 digis that represent **AUTOSAVE** light tube. We use _syphon_ to export the screen to `madmapper`(or resolume as your choice), Then the madmapper sent signal to the `LED RBG 5050 encoder` board to trigger on/off to `relays`, then it turn on/off the Fluorescent light tube. The software collects 10 digis data, user will be able to type word and it will push the displayed text to the right. you can also delete the text using DEL key. 
**_REMARK_** the display is not text but it's pictures. so you will be able to change earch png files in the folder data.

### How to use this shit!

You need the following shits to run this shit
  - Processing (https://processing.org/) 
  - Sound library for processing.
  - Syphon library for processing.

both library shits can be installed easily by Processing, just click
```sh
sktech > import library > add library
```
and search for Sound and Syphon, then click install.

### Thank you
