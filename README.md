[![N|Solid](http://autosave.io/img/ATS.svg)](http://autosave.io)

LightTube-Digi is a software specifically made for **SEENSPACE Huahin**, Thailand in 2016 Newyear Party, made by **AUTOSAVE studio** 


### Tell me what this does!
Basically, this software show 5 digis that represent **AUTOSAVE** light tube. We use _syphon_ to export the screen to `madmapper`(or resolume as your choice), Then the madmapper sent signal to the `LED RBG 5050 encoder` board to trigger on/off to `relays`, then it turn on/off the Fluorescent light tube. The software collects 10 digis data, user will be able to type alphabets, number, and able to type following special chars : '_', '-', '<', '>', '=', '|', '}'
and it will push the displayed text from right to left. 
There will be a click noise for every key.
User can also delete the text using DEL key, clear the text using tab key, and space using space key.


**_REMARK_** the display is not text but it's pictures. so you will be able to change earch png files in the folder data.

### How to use this shit!
